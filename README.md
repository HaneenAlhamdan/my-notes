## Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes
There are some issues that occur with most of the developed teams in the world, including:
It's hard to make small changes
Get rid of the code and rewrite it from scratch
Introducing a new bug by fixing another bug
There are some factors that can harm the project, and the developer can see that they are harmless, but in the long run, their destruction may appear on the project, especially during its construction and development.
To avoid such incidents, the developer should follow some tips:

1- **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**
Seriously understand the program, analyze it, know what its purpose and visualize it to facilitate writing the code and set priorities when making any decision

2-**The Goals of Software Design**
Setting clear goals to facilitate the process of modifying the program

3-**(Mis)understanding**
Stay away from complications while building the program to avoid misfortune

4-**Simplicity**
Setting clear goals to facilitate the process of modifying the program

5-**Complexity**
Stay away from complications while building the program to avoid misfortune

6-**Maintenance**
One of the most important things in software development is maintenance. When developing the program, some errors occur, so it must be maintained quickly to avoid crowding out errors and not controlling them. Simplicity and complexity are the two factors that affect code maintenance.

7-**Consistency**
Consistency and harmony in writing code to make it easier for other developers to understand

8-**Prioritizing**
There are factors for making appropriate decisions to set priorities:
 - The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
 - The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
 - The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
 The equation is simple: D=V/E
 The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

 9-**Solving Problems**
 The first step is to understand the problem well, try to explain it in your own way
The second step is planning, analyze the problem and do not rush to make a decision
The third step: Divide the problem into small tasks that are easy to deal with

 10-**Good enough is fine**
 Problems that the developer may encounter:
 - You will be writing code that isn’t needed
 - You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
 - You will be too generic
 - You will be missing deadlines
 - You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity

 ***The incremental design should be your guide. Here is how you would use it to design a calculator:***
 - Plan a system that does only addition and nothing else.
 - Implement it.
 - Improve the now-existing system’s design so you can add other operations also.
 - Plan subtraction and repeat step 2 and 3.
 - Plan multiplication and repeat step 2 and 3.
 - Plan division and repeat step 2 and 3.
